# Research Paper Inferences
This repository consists of a list of inferences and key takeaways I have drawn from reading research papers.<br><br>
The takeaways also contains references from not only the research paper itself, but also combines summaries of various other concepts and studies that are related to the paper, therfore giving a better understanding of the research.<br>
This is done in order to get a good understanding of what the paper is trying to emphasize and basically helps you make inferences from the paper yourself.
