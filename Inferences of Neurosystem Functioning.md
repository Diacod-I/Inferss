# Inferences of Neurosystem Functioning

## What exactly is the brain?

The brain is a complex organ that controls our thoughts, feelings, and actions. It is made up of billions of neurons, or nerve cells, that communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals.

Different areas of the brain are responsible for different functions.

Neurons communicate with each other through a process called synaptic transmission, in which chemical messengers called neurotransmitters are released from one neuron and bind to receptors on another neuron. This process allows information to be transmitted from one neuron to another, and allows the brain to process and respond to information from the environment.

The brain is also capable of changing and adapting over time, a process known as neuroplasticity. This allows the brain to learn and remember new information, and to adapt to changes in the environment or in our own behavior.

## Neuroplasticity and Ionic Channels in the brain

Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt over time. This means that the brain is constantly changing and rewiring itself in response to new experiences and learning. This rewiring occurs through changes in the connections between neurons or the growth of new neurons. Neuroplasticity is important for learning, memory, and recovery from brain injury.

> Neurons are specialized cells that transmit electrical signals throughout the body. Ion channels are tiny pores in the cell membrane of neurons that allow ions, or charged particles, to pass through. The flow of ions through ion channels is what generates the electrical signals that neurons use to communicate with each other.

There are different types of ion channels that are responsible for different functions in the brain. For example, some ion channels are responsible for generating action potentials, which are the electrical impulses that travel down the length of a neuron. Other ion channels are responsible for regulating the flow of ions into and out of the neuron, which is important for maintaining the electrical balance of the neuron. **This will be dicussed later.**

The function of ion channels can be altered by different factors, such as changes in the electrical charge of the neuron or the presence of certain chemicals or drugs. These changes in ion channel function can affect how neurons communicate with each other and can contribute to changes in neuroplasticity.

## Types of Ion Channels

- **Sodium channels**
    1. These channels allow positively charged sodium ions to flow into the neuron, which generates electrical signals known as action potentials. 
    2. Sodium channels are important for the transmission of signals between neurons.
- **Potassium channels**
    1. These channels allow positively charged potassium ions to flow out of the neuron, which helps to repolarize the neuron after an action potential.
    2. Potassium channels are important for regulating the electrical activity of neurons.
- **Calcium channels**
    1. These channels allow positively charged calcium ions to flow into the neuron, which can trigger a variety of cellular processes, such as neurotransmitter release and gene expression. 
    2. Calcium channels are important for a wide range of neuronal functions, including learning and memory.
- **Chloride channels**
    1. These channels allow negatively charged chloride ions to flow into or out of the neuron, depending on the specific type of channel. 
    2. Chloride channels play a role in regulating the electrical activity of neurons and can also contribute to the inhibition of neuronal activity.
- **NMDA receptors**
    1. These are a type of ion channel that is activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. 
    2. NMDA receptors are important for synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of neurons to change the strength of their connections in response to experience.

## Depolarization and Repolarization

In its resting state, the inside of a neuron has a negative charge relative to the outside, which creates a difference in electrical potential across the cell membrane. This difference in charge is known as the resting potential, and it is maintained by the selective permeability of the membrane to different ions, such as potassium and sodium.

Depolarization occurs when positive ions, such as sodium, enter the cell, making the inside of the cell less negative. This change in charge can trigger the neuron to fire an action potential, which is a rapid change in the electrical potential of the cell that allows it to transmit information to other neurons.

After an action potential is fired, the membrane potential returns to its resting state through a process called repolarization, in which the inside of the cell becomes negative again. This is achieved through the action of ion channels, which are specialized proteins in the membrane that allow certain ions to pass through.

## Sodium and Potassium Channels

Sodium and potassium channels work together in the brain to help generate and propagate electrical signals along neurons, which are important for communication between neurons and ultimately for brain function.

> When a neuron receives a signal from another neuron, it generates an electrical signal called an action potential.
> 
- The generation of an action potential is initiated by the opening of sodium channels in the neuron's membrane. When a neuron is at rest, the concentration of sodium ions is higher outside the neuron than inside, while the concentration of potassium ions is higher inside the neuron than outside. Sodium channels are closed at rest, preventing sodium ions from flowing into the neuron.
- When a neuron receives a signal, such as from a neurotransmitter binding to a receptor on its membrane, it opens sodium channels in response to the signal. This allows sodium ions to flow into the neuron, which depolarizes the membrane and generates an electrical signal. The influx of sodium ions is brief, however, because the sodium channels quickly inactivate, preventing further sodium influx.
- At this point, the potassium channels open, allowing potassium ions to flow out of the neuron, which repolarizes the membrane and restores the resting potential. The opening of potassium channels helps to terminate the action potential by counteracting the depolarizing effect of the sodium influx. Once the membrane potential has been restored to its resting level, the neuron is ready to receive another signal.

## Calcium Channels

Calcium channels are a type of ion channel in the brain that allow positively charged calcium ions to flow into the neuron when they are activated. Calcium channels are important for a wide range of neuronal functions, including neurotransmitter release, gene expression, and synaptic plasticity.

- Electrical signals that travel down the neuron's axon and reach the axon terminal, need the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse to jump to the next neurons.
- The release of neurotransmitters from the axon terminal is triggered by the influx of calcium ions into the neuron through calcium channels. When the electrical signal reaches the axon terminal, it opens the calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to flow into the neuron.
- The neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the dendrites of the next neuron, allowing the signal to be transmitted from one neuron to another.
- Calcium channels are also important for other functions in the brain, including gene expression and synaptic plasticity. Calcium ions can act as second messengers, which means they can activate a variety of cellular processes inside the neuron, including the activation of genes that are involved in synaptic plasticity.

## Types of Receptors

1. Chemoreceptors: These receptors are specialized to detect chemical substances in the environment, such as taste and smell receptors, as well as receptors in the blood vessels that detect changes in blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.
2. Photoreceptors: These receptors are specialized to detect light, such as the rods and cones in the retina of the eye.
3. Mechanoreceptors: These receptors are specialized to detect mechanical forces, such as touch, pressure, vibration, and sound. There are various subtypes of mechanoreceptors, including those that detect light touch, deep pressure, and stretch.
4. Thermoreceptors: These receptors are specialized to detect changes in temperature, both internal and external, such as those that control body temperature and those that detect changes in the external environment.
5. Nociceptors: These receptors are specialized to detect tissue damage or potential damage, and are responsible for the sensation of pain.

## Mechanoreceptors

Mechanoreceptors have several subtypes, each specialized to detect different types of mechanical stimuli. The most common subtypes include:

1. Meissner's corpuscles: These receptors are located in the dermal papillae of the skin, particularly in areas such as the fingertips, lips, and other areas with high tactile sensitivity. They are sensitive to light touch and vibration and have a rapid response to changes in stimuli.
2. Merkel cells: These receptors are located in the epidermis of the skin and are sensitive to sustained pressure and touch.
3. Pacinian corpuscles: These receptors are located deep in the skin and are sensitive to rapid changes in pressure and vibration.
4. Ruffini corpuscles: These receptors are located in the dermis of the skin and are sensitive to stretch and changes in skin tension.

When a mechanical stimulus is applied to the skin, it causes deformation or displacement of the mechanoreceptors, which triggers a series of events that generate electrical signals in the neurons connected to the mechanoreceptors. The electrical signals are then transmitted along sensory nerve fibers to the spinal cord and then to the brain, where they are processed and interpreted as touch or other tactile sensations.

The specific mechanisms by which mechanoreceptors work to generate electrical signals vary depending on the subtype of receptor, but generally involve the opening or closing of ion channels in the receptor membrane in response to mechanical deformation. This leads to changes in the flow of ions into or out of the receptor cell, generating a small electrical signal that is then amplified and transmitted by the sensory neurons.
